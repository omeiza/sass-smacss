#Introduction
**SASS-SMACSS** is a style-guide and workflow I personally use to make front end development easier using **SMACSS** principles and **SASS**. It basically helps you write sass in a more organised way.

A basic-level understanding of **SASS** and **SMACSS** architecture is needed, To get started with **SMACSS**, visit [SMACSS](http://www.smacss.com).

#Basic Usage

1. To use this style-guide, you need to link to the compiled CSS file (styles.css) in your template head tag like this:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css”>`
2. If you are familiar with SASS and you have it installed, you will need to use command line to navigate to your project root directory and `>_ sass watch` it. If you are not familiar with SASS, you can get started by visiting the [SASS website](http://www.sass-lang.com). It’s really easy to use.
3. This style-guide is really intuitive and you can remove folders and sass partials that does not apply to your project and add ones that does. But ensure that you use self-explanatory names and add comments if you need to.
